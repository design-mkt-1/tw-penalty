/* The scene effects layer: everything that moves and is not a character.

   The ball, its ground shadow, its motion blur, the net taking the shot and
   the celebration confetti are all drawn here, on one canvas, from one
   requestAnimationFrame loop. The DOM keeps only what has to stay a real
   element -- the .ball button, which is focusable and announced -- and hands
   the flight over to this file the moment a shot is taken.

   Why a canvas at all: a DOM ball cannot be motion-blurred, and a DOM shadow
   cannot separate from it convincingly. Those two are most of what makes a
   flight read as an object travelling away rather than a sticker shrinking.

   Every hand-tuned distance in here is in the same units js/game.js used:
   pixels at a 360px goal, multiplied by TWStage.unit(). */

     One number governs both how fast the ball crosses the screen and how
     small it gets, because in a real camera those are the same fact.

     A ball struck at constant speed away from the lens has its depth z grow
     linearly with time. A pinhole projects a lateral offset X at depth z to
     X/z on screen, so screen progress is (t/z) normalised -- strongly
     front-loaded -- and apparent size is 1/z. Deriving both from S_END means
     they can never disagree: at t=1 the ball is exactly on the panel centre
     at exactly S_END of its size, whatever else is retuned.

     The old code used smoothstep for progress and a linear ramp for scale.
     Smoothstep starts at zero velocity, which is why the ball used to leave
     the foot slowly -- the loudest single tell that this was not a game. */
