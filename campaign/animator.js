  /* Where the keeper ends up for each pose, as a share of his own box.
     L/R are from the viewer's point of view, matching the panel columns.
     The sprite already carries the body angle, so these are pure translations
     that carry the character across to the panel he is covering.

     Percentages, not pixels: translate() resolves them against the element's
     own size, and css/game.css sizes the keeper as a share of the goal. So a
     dive lands on the same panel whether the goal renders 260px wide or 560.

     Solved, not scaled. Every number here was re-derived when the Top Win
     figure replaced the reference project's, because a percentage of the
     keeper's own box is only a fixed distance across the goal while the box
     keeps its proportion to it -- and it did not: css/game.css now sizes the
     box at 21.81% of the goal's width against 22.95%, off a figure spanning
     .8562 of its canvas against .809.

     The method, for each of the four corner dives: measure where the reaching
     glove sits inside its own sprite as a fraction of the canvas -- the
     centroid of the 300 pixels furthest along the direction of the dive, so
     one stray pixel cannot define it -- then read the rendered panel centre
     and the rendered keeper box out of the live page and solve for the
     translation that lands the glove four points of the goal's width short of
     that centre. Four points short is the relationship the reference
     composition had, and short is signed by the direction of travel: towards
     the middle of the goal, not always leftwards.

     The panel centres have to be read from the page rather than computed,
     because .panels sets its gap and padding in clamp() and the centres move
     with the goal's size.

     Left and right came out 0.2 apart -- the sprite canvas is 429 wide, so an
     odd centre column makes a mirrored pair land a fifth of a percent
     differently. Averaged, because that difference is arithmetic rather than
     composition.

     The two centre poses are deliberately NOT translated. Both would have to
     leave the ground to reach their panel's centre: jump_center already
     reaches above it and would have to sink his feet below the goal line to
     come down to it, and jump_center_down is kneeling on that line and would
     have to hover. They keep x and y at zero and get their read from the
     pose, which is why each has its own render.

     The scales are a correction, not a flourish. Every pose where the keeper
     is off the ground came back from the generator with the character drawn
     smaller than the ones where he is standing on it -- measured on the head,
     which is the landmark a dive does not stretch: 53px wide on idle, 53 on
     jump_center_down, 53-59 across the standing poses, against 42-45 on all
     four airborne ones. He shrank the moment he jumped, which is what a
     visitor sees and what the earlier check missed: it compared feet lines and
     silhouette heights, and neither exists on a body in the air.

     So each airborne pose is scaled back to the standing head width -- 53/42
     for the low dives and the centre leap, 53/44 for the high dives -- and the
     translations above were re-solved with that scale applied, because scaling
     about the feet moves the glove. Correcting it in the sprite instead would
     mean scaling the figure inside a fixed canvas, and the low dive already
     spans .88 of its width: it would lose its gloves off the edge. */

  /* Where the dive meets the grass, and when.

     Two poses never come back down: jump_L2 and jump_R2 end high and wide.
     game.js used to fire the dust plume and a landing shake on `land` for
     every dive, so a keeper still a body-height in the air puffed grass at
     the goal line and shook the camera for an impact that never happened.

     The contact a high dive really has is the push-off, on `swap`, under
     where he was standing -- so that is the frame, that is the place, and it
     is softer than a body hitting the ground.

     `air` is a property of the pose now, not an inference from the sign of
     its y. It used to read `p.y < 0`, which was sound while the translation
     did the lifting and the sprite was neutral about height. It is not sound
     any more: the Top Win high-corner render already carries the glove near
     the top of its own canvas, so the solved translation is +0.71 rather than
     -19.57 and the old test would have called an airborne keeper landed.
     Same failure as the hand-written WRONG_WAY table -- a fact inferred from
     a number that stopped implying it. */
