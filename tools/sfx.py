"""Render the two sound effects the page was missing.

Five of the seven moments that make a noise already had a file. Two did not:
the confetti burst that follows a goal, and the keeper's head dropping after
he has been beaten. Both are written here rather than sourced, for the same
reason tools/ball_sheet.py draws the ball -- the output is reproducible from
the repository, carries no third-party licence onto a commercial landing
page, and can be re-tuned by editing a number instead of finding another
clip that nearly fits.

    python tools/sfx.py

Deterministic: every random draw comes from a seeded generator, so a rerun
writes byte-identical files and a diff means somebody changed the recipe.

Requires numpy (already needed by ball_sheet.py) and lameenc for the MP3
write -- `pip install lameenc`. Neither is needed to run the site.
